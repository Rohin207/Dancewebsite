          <h5>RohinAcademy <span>New York</span></h5>
          <p class="p">The main objective of the school is to nurture versatile dancers in a caring, dedicated and safe environment. Students are prepared for examinations in all disciplines taught at the school. Foreign examiners conduct annual examinations in all disciplines.The Dance Academy's firm belief that 'Dancing is fun' and 'healthy' is greatly witnessed by the variety of disciplines taught in the school for all ages. The 'fun' component is instrumental in nurturing in the students a passion for dance. The professional staff play a vital role in fostering the 'fun' element in their instruction. This cultivates in the student an appreciation of dance, in its many forms, and its performance. It also encourages the student to develop poise and self confidence as well as developing an awareness of fitness, - the 'healthy' aspect of dance.To further the students' development, foreign guest artists are invited annually to conduct workshops and courses in all disciplines.

          <h5>RohinAcademy <span>New York</span></h5>
          <p id="r">Our mission is to instill a great love of dance, while inspiring self-confidence, discipline and respect of the performing arts. We provide a solid technical foundation for the developing dancer. We advocate the study of Classical Ballet as a foundation to instill an awareness of poise, alignment and technique. Our goal is to give each individual dancer the tools they need to take dance as far as they dream to take it. We believe if you can dream it you can achieve it! Our instructors are skilled at identifying the specific needs of each student. We believe in an enriching education and we recognize that every student has something to offer the arts and the arts has something to every student.</p>
